```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

- Use this in case you're in a shell and nothing executes, because the path is empty. 

- The `PATH` variable tells your shell where to look for executable commands. 

- An **empty `$PATH`** makes your shell almost unusable unless you run commands with full paths (like `/bin/ls`).
