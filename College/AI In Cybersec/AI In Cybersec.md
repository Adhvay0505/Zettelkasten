# Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity

## What is Intelligence?

Intelligence is the ability to reason, generate new thoughts, perceive, and learn. It can be defined as a mechanism that:
- Stimulates responses
- Is triggered by various inputs
- Acts through processing
- Is stored as patterns
- Does not possess physical or chemical properties

## Core Components of Intelligence

1. **Action** - Executing responses based on input
2. **Further Thought** - Generating additional cognitive processes
3. **Information Generation** - Creating new data from existing knowledge
4. **Knowledge Generation** - Building understanding through experience

## Stimuli Types

- **External Stimulus** - Environmental inputs and triggers
- **Internal Stimulus** - Self-generated cognitive processes

## Biological Basis

The charged/discharged state of neurons forms the foundation of biological intelligence processing.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Learning from labeled training data
- Input-output pairs with known correct answers
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Applications: Spam detection, malware identification

### Unsupervised Learning
- Learning from unlabeled data without explicit feedback
- Finding hidden patterns and structures
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction
- Applications: Anomaly detection, user behavior analysis

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learning through interaction with environment
- Reward/punishment feedback system
- Agent learns optimal actions through trial and error
- Applications: Game playing, autonomous systems, security policy optimization

## AI Definition

**Artificial Intelligence**: Developing computer programs to solve complex problems by applying processes analogous to human reasoning and cognitive functions.
                                    Static Coding                                                                                    Dynamic Coding                       

## Knowledge
Knowledge is the information. facts, rules, relationships & experiences that 
an intelligent system uses to understand the world, reason & make decisions
